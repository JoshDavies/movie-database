A Font End App.  
This project is a React App with SCSS and TypeScript. 
  
This project was cloned from my previous project: [Theme-builder](https://github.com/JoshDavies/theme-builder)   
This allows me to continue working on the app I set up but still have the option to experiment with different programs & APIâ€™s.
