# Movie Database

A Font End React App with SCSS and TypeScript. 
  
This project was cloned from my previous project: [Theme-builder](https://github.com/JoshDavies/theme-builder) in order to continue working on it but to take it in a new direction and shift focus on to adding content via an API.

The MobX library has been added to the project to handle state management. I have used MobX before, however, they previously encouraged the use of decorators like ```@observable```. In MobX 6, they have now chosen to move away from them for maximum compatibility with standard JavaScript. [MobX Docs.](https://mobx.js.org/installation.html) It is still possible to enable decorators but they are no longer recommended for new projects. So I am interested to try out the use of ```makeObservable``` instead!
